<H1>About</H1>
<body>
A program written as part of my introduction to Java programming class. This program receives a text file containing a maze and outputs a path from start to finish.

  Samples mazes are located in the tests directory of this repository. The maze is represented textually by a matrix of characters; the (“*”) character represents a wall, and space (“ “) represents an open square. The first three lines of the text file have specific meanings and each number is seperated by a single space:
<ul>
  <li>Line 1: dimensions (length x and width y)</li>
  <li>Line 2: start coordinates (x,y)</li>
  <li>Line 3: end coordinates (x,y)</li> 
</ul>
